# MovieBST
Implemented a Binary Search Tree on a movie ratings dataset and analyzed runtime using Big-O notation

Through this, I learned that the depth of a BST directly affects how efficient the maximum algorithm is. If the data is ordered, the BST performs worse than if the data is random because ordered data takes O(n) time to search, while the random data takes O(log(n)) time.
